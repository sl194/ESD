**Format:**

* Pillar Dialogue (open invite of ESD population)

## Course Planner

We aim to ease the planning process for students and admin staff regarding to the ever more complicating course/track/minor requirements.
<br><br>

**Currently stable version of the planner is available [here](https://course-planner.opensutd.org/)**

The current version is reactive<br>
In future development, we would also like to make a recommendation system for course-plan/module given student's strength or interest.

** This is a constant process of updating and maintaining the planner, and we seek interested people to join this open source project. Please email ```zhi_zhou@mymail.sutd.edu.sg``` if interested.
